LibraryBooks

This project consists of an online library. It does not stores all the content of a book, but only its metadata, which means only informations about it.
You can store a <b>TITLE</b>, an <b>AUTHOR</b> and the <b>NUMBER OF PAGES</b> who make up this book.
Of course, you can also edit the informations of an already saved book.
If ever, you don't like, or don't care about a book, you can delete it.

All your stored books will be displayed in a beautiful page that will remind you a vintage library.
